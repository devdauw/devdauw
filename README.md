### ðŸ‘‹ Hello folks ! 

- I like to experiment with new technologies :man_technologist:, building small projects is the best way to learn.
- Transitioned to computer development later in my life than most, a late coder if you wish ðŸŒ±. Would love to get full-stack knowledge!
- This is my private Github, not the one I use for my job, so commits are quite low!

#### ðŸ’» Current projects

- Creating my blog & portfolio using [Astro](https://astro.build)
- Creating a random password generator using words from multiple languages.
